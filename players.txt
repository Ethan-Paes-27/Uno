NOTE the format of the above lines!  Each line consists of a display name, a comma, NO SPACE, then the name
      of the team WITHOUT the "_UnoPlayer".

      To use this file, run UnoSimulation.  (The first two constants in that file are important.  You can
      change the number of games played as well as whether to print all details of the hands...)

      You can play 2 or more teams here.  WE will only use four-team matches in the class competition.

      If you do use TeamHuman, note that when you must call the color the input should be "R", "B", "G", or "Y".

      Once you have working code for your class, you might want to use three random teams and your team to see
      how your code competes against TeamRandom :)
